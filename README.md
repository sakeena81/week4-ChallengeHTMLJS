# week4-ChallengeHTMLJS
Making a Calculator 
(FunctioningHTMLCalculator)

#### THE TASK AT HAND:... 
Build a HTML calculator from scratch using JavaScript, 

#### By _**Sakeena Ali**_

## What was the Challenge?
Luckily we were not expected to build a scientific calculator, but a basic calculator, that functions as a calculator...there is an image of the type of the calculator expected in my repository titled as CALC EXPECTATIONS... 

*QUIZ TIME! How many times does the word CALCULATOR appear in this README?(answer is at the bottom)*


## How I expected the challenge to go.
Lets just say, I now see the calculator in a whole new way, like many things, its a tool I have taken for granted. I take my hat off to the person who decided to jump from the abacus to a digital calculator. 

From previous experience, and in regards to solving a problem in general is to break it down. If looking at a calculator visually, it is a table enclosed in a container, basically a table made of rows and columns with cells to contain the table data. Then break that table down into two parts, which is the display and the keys. 

But again its not that simple, there are aspects that require consideration, for example the screen must be display only, the values can only be assigned to the numbered keys, and then to further break it down the operators can only be the (+, ‚àí, ‚®â, √∑, = buttons) and somehow make these working operators.

So in theory it seems very possible to build a calculator. 

## what went well

Again, Im able to refer back to the recordings to remind myself of the basic formats and rules of HTML, and my obsession with trying to understand tiny details, means I have a vast collection of VISUAL STUDIO CODE files, and I refuse to get rid of any practice coding I have done, as there maybe something there that will come in useful. 

I am going to try to explain some of the steps I took as technically as possible, but somehow I know how to use the rules of HTML, but to explain what I am doing, is a task in itself. 

First I tried to use the form elements to serve as a wrapper( otherwise known as a container) for which the main calculator components will sit inside. However, this is more for aesthetic reasons, so I made an excecutive decision and moved onto making the table instead...(making an ikea table with screws missing compared to a HTML table is far more doable) However, rubbish comparisions aside, I created a table using the 'table' tag in which the 'tr' tag is used to create table rows and 'td' is used to create data cells.

Once you create one row, its a matter of copying and pasting, until all rows and data cells are created, its simply adjusting the numerical values and operations for each table cell. 

Also what went well, is the amazing group of people that I can turn to for some advice or help, a fellow TDPr helped me through code to atleast give a back drop colour to my calculator. Which already is not the prettiest thing, so I gave it the prettiest colour in the rainbow...a lovely shade of Pink, in particular Coral Pink, Hot Pink was suggested, but its not that type of calculator. 


## what didnt go as planned?
TRYING TO MAKE THE CALCULATOR PRETTY! + the stretch goals. 

(All I can say, the intensity of the training, where we began with the theory of Agile in which we were taught about breaking a project into small parts until its understood, seems to have become lost in translation in the coming weeks.
I translated the idea of Agile as the classic 'how do you eat an elephantüêò?... well of course, one bite at a time', what seems to have happened instead is 'said' Elephant was thrown at us, along with its herd üêòüêòüêòüêòüêò...)

Honestly speaking, to have a functioning calculator after just five days of HTML and Javascript, never mind the fact that the calculator has no decimal button either, is the stretch itself. 

## Possible improvements for future challenges

#### to put it bluntly... PLEASE GIVE ME MORE TIME TO LEARN AT LEAST ONE LANGUAGE, AND ALLOW ME TO BECOME A GURU AT IT!

(quiz time answer...calculator word appears the number of times this project stressed me out..üò≠)
